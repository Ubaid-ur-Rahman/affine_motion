# Image Stabilization with Affine Motion Estimation

## Overview
This Python notebook presents an implementation of image stabilization using affine motion estimation. The code stabilizes a video by applying affine transformations to individual frames. It achieves this by estimating the motion between the current frame and the previous frame and then compensating for this motion.

The key components of this implementation are as follows:

### 1. Affine Motion Estimation
The heart of this code is the estimation of affine motion between consecutive frames. Affine motion is a more general transformation than translation and includes rotation, scaling, and skewing. The code calculates the affine transformation matrix that describes the motion from one frame to the next.

### 2. Motion Compensation
Once the affine transformation is estimated, it is used to compensate for the motion between frames. This compensation involves warping the current frame using the estimated affine transformation. This process helps align the current frame with the previous frame, reducing motion-induced jitter or instability.

### 3. Flow Field Computation
The motion between the frames is often computed using optical flow techniques. This code may include optical flow algorithms to calculate the flow field, which describes how pixels in the current frame have moved relative to the previous frame. This flow field is then used to estimate the affine transformation.

## How to Use
To apply image stabilization to your video, follow these steps:

Open the Jupyter notebook Image_Stabilization.ipynb in your Jupyter environment.

Ensure you have the necessary video input (e.g., an MP4 file) or webcam access, depending on your setup.

Execute the notebook cells sequentially to process the video frames and stabilize the video.

The stabilized video will be saved as an output file or displayed in real-time, depending on your chosen configuration.

## Dependencies
This implementation may require certain Python libraries and packages. Please review the notebook's initial cells or documentation for a list of dependencies and installation instructions.
